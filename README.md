# Welcome to ARToolkit2

## WTF is this?
- A few months ago, when the initial hoss attacks occured, I offered a solution to the community in the form of ARToolkit1
- ARToolkit1 was incredibly slow and hard to update, and on top of that, included a lot of manual labor on my end and the user's end
- ARToolkit2 will run 24/7 in the cloud, with completely customizable instances per-user

## Okay, so where TF is the bot?
- The bot is closed-source until I secure proper licensing and copyright
- The reason for this is due to the Streamlabs incident, as they also ripped off ARToolkit1 in their "ripping off other creators without crediting them" binge.
- Otherwise, I usually have everything open-source

## Cool, I want to use the bot. Do I need anything here?
- Nope! This is just here for extra trust measures so you know *exactly* what the bot does.
- This repo is the exact website you see at https://artoolkit.ashemuller.tk/, because AWS Amplify clones this every time I make a commit

## What is the purpose of the "add" button on the site/What does it do
Three steps:
1) Gets permission to view and edit your chat + moderators
2.) Mods "artoolkit", my bot user, for you
3.) Adds you to my SQL user database so the backend knows to run your profile

## Why did you add a dashboard even though nothing happens?
- Nothing happens, yet.
- I still need to work on uploading the backend and finishing it, which will take a while
- This was where I was in production of the website when I was able to *not only* mod it in your chat, but send your username to my database as well, because there is no point in having moderation powers in a bunch of channels when you don't know what channels to moderate.

## Discord server?
- Soon!

## Patreon?
- Absolutely at some point! AWS is not 100% free (unfortunately), and if the demand gets high enough, I'm going to unfortunately have to start paying bills :p
